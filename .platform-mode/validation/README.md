# Validation Directory

This directory contains acceptance criteria definitions, test plans, and validation artifacts for ensuring quality delivery.

## Structure

- `acceptance-criteria/` - Detailed acceptance criteria for stories and epics
- `test-plans/` - Comprehensive testing strategies and scenarios
- `quality-gates/` - Automated and manual quality checkpoints
- `demo-scripts/` - Sprint review and demo preparation materials

## Validation Artifact Types

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given-When-Then** scenarios for behavior validation
- **Performance criteria** for non-functional requirements
- **Security criteria** for compliance and risk management
- **Usability criteria** for user experience validation

### Test Plans
- **Unit testing** strategies for code validation
- **Integration testing** for system behavior validation
- **End-to-end testing** for complete workflow validation
- **Non-functional testing** for performance, security, and scalability

## Usage

Use validation slash commands:
- `/acceptance-test` - Generate test cases from acceptance criteria
- `/quality-gate` - Create automated quality checkpoints
- `/demo-prep` - Prepare sprint demo materials
