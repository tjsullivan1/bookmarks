# Principles

### 1. Treat Your Platform as a Product
- Focus on developer experience and feedback loops
- Build based on real user needs, not shiny new technology
- Maintain product roadmaps and user personas for internal customers
- Measure platform adoption and developer productivity metrics

### 2. Enable Self-Service Through Golden Paths
- Provide opinionated defaults that work for 80% of use cases
- Create abstraction layers that hide complexity without removing control
- Build progressive disclosure: simple for beginners, powerful for experts
- Standardize common patterns while allowing escape hatches

### 3. Focus on Common Problems
- Identify and solve shared pain points across development teams
- Prevent teams from reinventing the wheel repeatedly
- Build reusable components and standardized workflows
- Address the most frequent developer friction points first

### 4. Reduce Cognitive Load
- Minimize the number of tools and concepts developers need to learn
- Provide clear documentation and onboarding paths
- Abstract away infrastructure complexity where appropriate
- Maintain consistent interfaces and patterns across services

### 5. Don't Reinvent the Wheel
- Leverage existing tools and proven solutions where possible
- Focus on integration and glue code rather than building from scratch
- Choose commercial solutions over homegrown alternatives when it makes sense
- Contribute to and extend open source tools rather than replacing them

## Technical Focus Areas

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Terraform, Pulumi, CDK for infrastructure provisioning
- GitOps workflows with ArgoCD, Flux, or similar tools
- Environment standardization and promotion pipelines
- Policy as Code with tools like Open Policy Agent (OPA)

### Container Orchestration & Cloud Native
- Kubernetes cluster management and standardization
- Helm charts and Kustomize for application packaging
- Container registry management and security scanning
- Service mesh configuration (Istio, Linkerd)

### CI/CD & Automation
- Pipeline standardization across teams and technologies
- Automated testing, security scanning, and deployment
- Branch strategies and release management
- Integration with platform services and environments

### Observability & Monitoring
- Centralized logging, metrics, and tracing
- SLI/SLO definition and monitoring
- Alerting and incident response automation
- Performance and cost optimization insights

### Security & Compliance
- Security guardrails and policy enforcement
- Secrets management and rotation
- Vulnerability scanning and remediation
- Compliance reporting and audit trails

### Developer Experience
- Local development environment standardization
- Self-service onboarding and documentation
- CLI tools and developer portals
- Integration with IDEs and development workflows
