## 6. Decision Log and Lessons Learned

### 6.1 Implementation Decisions

#### Decision DEC-001: Terraform Module Structure
**Date**: October 25, 2025
**Context**: Need to establish Terraform module organization that supports multiple environments and follows platform standards
**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Single monolithic Terraform file
2. Separate modules per Azure service
3. Single comprehensive module with environment variables
**Decision**: Single comprehensive module with environment-based configuration
**Rationale**: Provides balance between maintainability and simplicity, follows platform engineering standards
**Consequences**: Easier maintenance, consistent patterns, slight increase in initial complexity
**Review Date**: End of Sprint 1

#### Decision DEC-002: Azure Resource Naming Convention
**Date**: October 25, 2025
**Context**: Need consistent naming across all Azure resources that supports multiple environments
**Alternatives Considered**:
1. `{project}-{env}-{resource}` format
2. `{env}-{project}-{resource}` format
3. `{env}{project}{resource}` format (no separators)
**Decision**: `{env}-{project}-{resource}` format with hyphens
**Rationale**: Environment first enables easy filtering, hyphens improve readability
**Consequences**: Clear environment separation, Azure naming constraints may require abbreviations
**Review Date**: After first environment deployment

#### Decision DEC-003: Cosmos DB Billing Model
**Date**: October 25, 2025
**Context**: Choose between provisioned throughput and serverless billing for development environment
**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Provisioned throughput (400 RU/s minimum)
2. Serverless billing (pay per request)
**Decision**: Serverless billing for development, evaluate provisioned for production
**Rationale**: Cost optimization for development workloads, easier to start
**Consequences**: Lower development costs, need to monitor for production suitability
**Review Date**: Sprint 3 production planning

### 6.2 Technical Trade-offs

#### Infrastructure Complexity vs. Maintainability
**Trade-off**: Comprehensive Terraform module vs. simpler separate resources
**Decision**: Comprehensive module with clear internal organization
**Impact**: Higher initial complexity, better long-term maintainability and consistency

#### Security vs. Development Velocity
**Trade-off**: Full security hardening vs. rapid development iteration
**Decision**: Core security patterns from Sprint 1, enhanced security in Sprint 3
**Impact**: Balanced approach enabling development progress while establishing security foundation

#### Monitoring Complexity vs. Operational Insight
**Trade-off**: Basic monitoring vs. comprehensive observability from start
**Decision**: Basic Application Insights in Sprint 1, enhanced monitoring in Sprint 3
**Impact**: Faster initial delivery, comprehensive monitoring when needed for production

### 6.3 Lessons Learned (Continuous Update)

#### Sprint Planning Insights
- **Dependency Management**: Early identification of Azure subscription dependency critical
- **Capacity Planning**: 15% buffer allocation appropriate for infrastructure work uncertainty
- **Skill Development**: Terraform training should occur before sprint start, not during

#### Technical Implementation Insights
- **Module Design**: Starting with clear file organization saves refactoring later
- **Variable Validation**: Comprehensive input validation prevents deployment errors
- **Documentation**: Creating documentation parallel with implementation is more efficient

#### Quality Assurance Insights
- **Testing Strategy**: Infrastructure validation scripts should be prepared before implementation
- **Security Integration**: Early security pattern establishment easier than retrofitting
- **Performance Baseline**: Establishing baselines early enables optimization tracking
