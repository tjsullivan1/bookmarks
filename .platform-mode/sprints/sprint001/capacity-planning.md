### Capacity Rebalancing Plan

#### Load Redistribution
To address Senior Platform Engineer's over-allocation:

**Story 005 Task Redistribution**:
- **Senior Platform Engineer retains**: T005.1 (Cosmos account), T005.2 (Database/container), T005.7 (Documentation) = 12h
- **DevOps Engineer takes**: T005.3 (Backup policies), T005.4 (Security config), T005.6 (Testing) = 10h
- **Full-Stack Developer supports**: T005.5 (Connection outputs), integration testing support = 2h

**Revised Allocations**:
- **Senior Platform Engineer**: 20 points, 70 hours → **Balanced**
- **DevOps Engineer**: 14 points, 52 hours → **Well-balanced with buffer**
- **Full-Stack Developer**: 14 points, 54 hours → **Well-balanced**
