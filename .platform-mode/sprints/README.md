# Sprints Directory

This directory contains sprint planning artifacts and execution tracking for iterative platform development.

## Structure

Each sprint should be organized as: `sprint###/` directory containing:
- `sprint-plan.md` - Sprint goals, backlog, and commitments
- `daily-standups.md` - Daily standup notes and blockers
- `sprint-review.md` - Sprint demo and review outcomes
- `sprint-retrospective.md` - What went well, what didn't, action items

## Sprint Planning Template Structure

- **Sprint Goal**: Clear, measurable objective for the sprint
- **Sprint Backlog**: Committed stories and tasks
- **Capacity**: Team availability and velocity considerations
- **Dependencies**: Cross-team or external dependencies
- **Definition of Done**: Sprint-level completion criteria
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identified risks and mitigation strategies

## Usage

Use the `/sprint-plan` slash command to initialize a new sprint with the standardized template structure.
