# Epic 001: Infrastructure as Code Automation Platform

## Summary
- **Epic Goal**: Establish infrastructure automation capability that enables self-service environment provisioning with proper security and monitoring foundations
- **Business Value**: Reduces manual infrastructure management overhead by 90% and enables consistent, repeatable environment deployment across development, staging, and production
- **Estimated Effort**: 54 story points (Sprint 1 - 2 weeks)
- **Target Timeline**: November 8, 2025

## Problem Statement

Development teams currently lack a reliable, consistent way to provision cloud infrastructure for the bookmarks application. Manual Azure resource creation leads to configuration drift, security inconsistencies, and significant time investment from platform engineers. The organization needs infrastructure automation that:

- Eliminates manual resource provisioning and configuration drift
- Provides consistent security and networking configurations across environments
- Enables self-service capabilities for development teams
- Reduces platform engineer toil while improving system reliability
- Establishes foundation patterns for future platform engineering initiatives

**Current State**: Manual Azure resource creation through the portal, inconsistent configurations, no version control for infrastructure changes, high platform engineer involvement for environment provisioning.

**Future State**: Fully automated infrastructure provisioning via Terraform with consistent security, monitoring, and networking patterns. Self-service capability for development teams with platform engineer oversight only for policy changes.

**Strategic Alignment**: This epic aligns with the organization's platform engineering strategy to reduce cognitive load on development teams while improving system reliability and security posture.
