## Problem Statement

Organizations often struggle with production readiness validation and operational knowledge transfer, leading to post-deployment issues, operational inefficiencies, and knowledge gaps that impact long-term system maintainability. Without comprehensive testing, documentation, and knowledge transfer, systems may experience:

- Production performance issues not discovered during development
- Operational procedures that are unclear or inadequate for production support
- Knowledge silos that create single points of failure for system maintenance
- Insufficient disaster recovery capabilities and untested recovery procedures
- Poor operational documentation leading to extended incident resolution times
- Inadequate team preparation for ongoing system support and enhancement

**Current State**: Limited production readiness validation, insufficient operational documentation, and ad-hoc knowledge transfer processes that create operational risks and support challenges.

**Future State**: Comprehensive production validation with complete operational documentation, trained support teams, and validated disaster recovery capabilities enabling confident production deployment and long-term operational success.
