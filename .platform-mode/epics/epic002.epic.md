# Epic 002: CI/CD Pipeline Automation Platform

## Summary
- **Epic Goal**: Enable developer self-service deployment with automated container builds, security scanning, and production deployment capabilities
- **Business Value**: Reduces deployment time from hours to minutes while improving security and reliability through automated quality gates and deployment validation
- **Estimated Effort**: 54 story points (Sprint 2 - 2 weeks)
- **Target Timeline**: November 22, 2025

## Problem Statement

Development teams currently lack automated deployment capabilities, requiring manual coordination between developers, platform engineers, and operations teams for each deployment. This manual process creates bottlenecks, increases deployment risk, and limits the organization's ability to deliver features rapidly and reliably.

The current deployment process involves:
- Manual container builds with inconsistent configurations
- Manual deployment coordination requiring platform engineer involvement
- Lack of automated security scanning exposing vulnerability risks
- No automated rollback capabilities requiring manual recovery procedures
- Limited deployment validation leading to production issues

**Current State**: Manual deployment process taking 2-4 hours with high coordination overhead, inconsistent build processes, manual security validation, and high risk of deployment failures.

**Future State**: Fully automated CI/CD pipeline enabling developers to deploy changes to production within 10 minutes with automated security scanning, quality gates, and rollback capabilities.

**Strategic Alignment**: This epic enables the organization's DevOps transformation by implementing automated deployment capabilities that reduce time-to-market while improving security and reliability.
