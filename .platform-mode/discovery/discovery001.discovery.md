# Discovery Document 001: Bookmarks Platform Infrastructure Modernization

**Document ID**: discovery001.discovery.md
**Created**: October 25, 2025
**Discovery Lead**: Platform Engineering Team
**Phase**: Discovery
**Status**: Initial Research Complete

---

## Executive Summary

This discovery session focuses on understanding the infrastructure and platform engineering needs for the existing Bookmarks web application. The application currently exists as a proof-of-concept with React frontend, FastAPI backend, and Azure Cosmos DB integration, but lacks production-ready infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and operational capabilities.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### What specific problem are we trying to solve?
The Bookmarks application currently exists as a development prototype without production-ready infrastructure. Users (developers and platform teams) lack:
- Automated deployment pipelines
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) management
- Production environment provisioning
- Monitoring and observability
- Scalable hosting architecture
- Security best practices implementation

### Who is experiencing this problem?
- **Development Teams**: Cannot deploy to production environments reliably
- **Platform Engineering Team**: Lack standardized infrastructure patterns
- **DevOps Engineers**: Manual deployment processes create bottlenecks
- **Business Stakeholders**: Cannot deliver value to end users without production deployment

### What is the business impact of this problem?
- **Time to Market**: Manual processes delay feature delivery
- **Risk**: Manual deployments increase failure probability
- **Cost**: Inefficient resource utilization and manual overhead
- **Scalability**: Cannot handle production load or user growth
- **Compliance**: Lack of proper security and audit controls

### How is this problem currently being addressed?
- Local development environment only
- Manual testing processes
- No production infrastructure
- Ad-hoc deployment approaches
