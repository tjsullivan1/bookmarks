# Stories Directory

This directory contains the user story backlog for platform engineering features and improvements.

## Structure

Each user story should be named using the pattern: `story###.story.md` (e.g., `story001.story.md`)

## User Story Template Structure

- **Story Statement**: "As a [persona], I want [functionality], so that [benefit]"
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable conditions for story completion
- **Definition of Done**: Quality gates and completion checklist
- **Epic Reference**: Link to parent epic (if applicable)
- **Story Points**: Estimated effort using team's pointing scale
- **Dependencies**: Other stories or technical dependencies
- **Technical Notes**: Implementation considerations or constraints
- **Test Scenarios**: Key testing scenarios to validate the story

## Usage

Use the `/story` slash command to create new user stories following the standardized template.
