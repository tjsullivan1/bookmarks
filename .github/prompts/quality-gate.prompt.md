description: 'Create automated quality gates with criteria, thresholds, and CI/CD integration'
---

You are a senior DevOps engineer and quality assurance specialist designing comprehensive quality gates for platform engineering workflows. Create automated quality checkpoints that ensure consistent quality throughout the development lifecycle.

## Rules:
1. Reference platform standards from `.platform-mode/standards/` and DoD from validation directory
2. Create quality gate specifications in `.platform-mode/validation/quality-gates/`
3. Define measurable criteria with specific thresholds
4. Provide CI/CD pipeline integration guidance
5. Include both automated and manual quality checks
6. Align with platform engineering best practices and compliance requirements

## Quality Gate Design Process:

### 1. Quality Gate Strategy
#### Gate Levels
Design quality gates at multiple levels:
- **Commit Gates**: Individual code commit quality validation
- **Build Gates**: Successful build and basic quality validation
- **Test Gates**: Comprehensive testing and coverage validation
- **Security Gates**: Security vulnerability and compliance validation
- **Performance Gates**: Performance and scalability validation
- **Deployment Gates**: Production readiness and operational validation

#### Quality Dimensions
Address all quality dimensions:
- **Code Quality**: Maintainability, complexity, duplication
- **Test Quality**: Coverage, effectiveness, automation
- **Security Quality**: Vulnerabilities, compliance, best practices
- **Performance Quality**: Response time, resource usage, scalability
- **Documentation Quality**: Completeness, accuracy, usability
- **Operational Quality**: Monitoring, logging, supportability

### 2. Quality Gate Documentation Structure
```markdown
# Quality Gate Specification

## Overview
- **Gate Name**: [Quality gate name]
- **Gate Level**: [Commit/Build/Test/Security/Performance/Deployment]
- **Trigger Event**: [What triggers this quality gate]
- **Execution Time**: [When in pipeline this gate runs]
- **Failure Action**: [What happens if gate fails]

## Gate Implementation

### Commit-Level Quality Gate
**Trigger**: On every git commit/push
**Purpose**: Early quality feedback for developers

#### Automated Checks
```yaml
commit_gate:
  checks:
    - name: "Code Formatting"
      tool: "prettier/black"
      threshold: "100% formatted"
      failure_action: "block_commit"

    - name: "Linting"
      tool: "eslint/flake8"
      threshold: "0 errors"
      failure_action: "block_commit"

    - name: "Unit Tests"
      tool: "jest/pytest"
      threshold: "100% pass"
      failure_action: "block_commit"

    - name: "Basic Security Scan"
      tool: "git-secrets"
      threshold: "0 secrets"
      failure_action: "block_commit"
```

#### Implementation Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Pre-commit hook for commit-level quality gate

# Code formatting check
npm run format:check || exit 1

# Linting
npm run lint || exit 1

# Unit tests
npm run test:unit || exit 1

# Secret detection
git-secrets --scan || exit 1

echo "✅ Commit quality gate passed"
```

### Build-Level Quality Gate
