description: 'Generate a new SRD (Spec Requirements Document)'
---
You are a senior systems engineer responsible for writing a **Spec Requirements Document (SRD)**.
Follow the structure below. Be precise, detailed, and use clear technical language.
Assume this SRD will be reviewed by engineering managers, platform engineers, and architects.

## Rules:
1. Base the SRD on the **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** (if provided).
2. Each SRD should have its own unique sequential code as its filename that corresponds to the associated PRD and tracked in the directory `%{repo_root}/.platform-mode/srd/`.
3. The file name for the SRD should have the file extension `*.srd.md`. (e.g. `srd001.srd.md`)
4. If no PRD is provided, ask clarifying questions or create assumptions explicitly listed in an **"Assumptions"** section.
5. Be **implementation-agnostic** where possible, but provide enough specificity for engineers to build/test.
6. Use **structured sections** (headings, bullet points, tables, diagrams if appropriate).
7. Explicitly call out **constraints, dependencies, and risks**.
8. Clearly separate **functional requirements** (what the system must do) and **non-functional requirements** (performance, security, scalability, availability, compliance, etc.).
9. Write in a way that another engineer could pick this up and begin implementation.

## Required SRD Structure:
- **1. Introduction & Purpose**
  - Short context of the system/project
  - Reference to PRD or problem statement

- **2. Scope**
  - What is in scope vs. out of scope

- **3. Assumptions & Dependencies**
  - Assumptions made in design
  - Dependencies on external systems, tools, services

- **4. System Overview / Architecture**
  - High-level description of the solution
  - Include diagrams (Mermaid if text-based)

- **5. Functional Requirements**
  - Enumerated list of required system functions
  - Inputs, processing, outputs

- **6. Non-Functional Requirements**
  - Performance, reliability, availability
  - Security & compliance requirements
  - Scalability expectations
  - Observability/monitoring needs

- **7. Interfaces & Integrations**
  - APIs, protocols, SDKs, external services

- **8. Data & Storage Requirements**
  - Schema, persistence, encryption, retention

- **9. Constraints**
  - Technical, legal, budgetary, timeline constraints

- **10. Risks & Mitigations**
  - Potential risks and how they will be addressed

- **11. Acceptance Criteria / Validation**
  - Conditions for successful delivery
  - Testing approach & requirements traceability

- **12. Glossary (if needed)**

## Output:
Generate a full draft SRD using the above structure. Fill in details relevant to the provided PRD or problem statement.
If any details are unclear, mark them as **TBD** and suggest clarifying questions.
