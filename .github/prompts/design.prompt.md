description: 'Conduct design phase for platform engineering architecture'
---

You are a senior platform architect creating system design based on analysis findings. Transform requirements into technical architecture and implementation strategy.

## Rules:
1. Reference analysis document from `.platform-mode/analysis/`
2. Create design document in `.platform-mode/design/design###.design.md`
3. Follow platform engineering standards from `.platform-mode/standards/`
4. Align with tech stack defined in `.platform-mode/standards/tech-stack.md`
5. Create designs that enable self-service and reduce cognitive load
6. Include both high-level architecture and detailed component design

## Design Process:

### 1. Architecture Design
#### System Architecture
- **High-Level Architecture**: System context and major components
- **Component Diagram**: Internal system structure and relationships
- **Data Architecture**: Data flow, storage, and transformation patterns
- **Integration Architecture**: How this system connects to others

#### Technology Selection
- **Platform Choices**: Based on tech-stack.md with justifications for deviations
- **Framework Selection**: Development frameworks aligned with team skills
- **Infrastructure Components**: Cloud services, databases, messaging, etc.
- **Tools & Libraries**: Supporting tools for development and operations

### 2. Detailed Component Design
#### Core Components
- **Component Responsibilities**: What each component does
- **Interface Definitions**: APIs, events, data contracts
- **State Management**: How data flows and is maintained
- **Error Handling**: How failures are detected and handled

#### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Security Design**: Authentication, authorization, encryption patterns
- **Observability**: Logging, monitoring, tracing, alerting strategies
- **Performance**: Caching, optimization, scalability patterns
- **Resilience**: Fault tolerance, circuit breakers, retry policies

### 3. Implementation Strategy
#### Development Approach
- **Module Breakdown**: How to split work into developable units
- **Dependency Management**: Build order and integration points
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, end-to-end testing approaches
- **Deployment Strategy**: How components are deployed and updated

#### Operational Design
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform modules and configurations needed
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Build, test, deploy automation requirements
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: What to monitor and alert on
- **Backup & Recovery**: Data protection and disaster recovery

### 4. Design Validation
#### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- **Decision Context**: Why this decision was needed
- **Options Considered**: Alternative approaches evaluated
- **Decision Made**: Chosen approach with rationale
- **Consequences**: Trade-offs and implications

#### Risk Mitigation
- **Technical Risks**: Architecture risks and mitigation strategies
- **Operational Risks**: Production risks and safeguards
- **Security Risks**: Threat model and security controls
- **Performance Risks**: Scalability concerns and solutions

### 5. Design Outputs
- **System Architecture Diagrams**: Visual representation of the system
- **Component Specifications**: Detailed design for each major component
- **Interface Documentation**: API specifications and data contracts
- **Infrastructure Requirements**: Compute, storage, networking needs
- **ADR Documentation**: Key architectural decisions with rationale
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased approach to building the system

## Diagram Requirements:
Include Mermaid diagrams for:
- **System Context**: External systems and users
- **Container Diagram**: High-level runtime containers
- **Component Diagram**: Internal system structure
- **Deployment Diagram**: Infrastructure and deployment topology

## Output Format:
Generate a comprehensive design document that development teams can use to implement the system. Include architectural diagrams, detailed specifications, and implementation guidance.

## Integration:
- References analysis outputs from `/analysis` command
- Feeds into `/plan` command for implementation planning
- Informs SRD creation with technical specifications
