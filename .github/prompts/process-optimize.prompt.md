## Root Cause Analysis

### Top 3 Process Issues

#### Issue #1: Code Review Bottleneck
**Impact**: 75% wait time, 1.8 days average review time
**Root Causes**:
- Limited reviewer pool (3 senior developers for 8-person team)
- No review time allocation in sprint planning
- Large pull requests difficult to review efficiently
- No review SLA or escalation process

**5 Whys Analysis**:
1. Why are code reviews taking 1.8 days on average?
   → Because there's often a queue of reviews waiting
2. Why is there a queue of reviews?
   → Because only 3 people can do thorough reviews
3. Why do only 3 people do reviews?
   → Because we haven't trained others on review best practices
4. Why haven't we trained others?
   → Because senior developers are too busy with feature work
5. Why are senior developers too busy?
   → Because we don't allocate specific time for mentoring and reviews

**Business Impact**:
- $89K annual cost in delayed features
- 23% of total cycle time waste
- Developer frustration and context switching

#### Issue #2: Test Environment Coordination
**Impact**: 40% wait time in testing phase, 1.2 days average
**Root Causes**:
- Manual test environment provisioning and management
- Environment conflicts between parallel testing efforts
- Inconsistent test data setup across environments
- No automated environment reset capabilities

                       |
                  Environment
```

#### Issue #3: Story Estimation Inconsistency
**Impact**: 25% velocity unpredictability, frequent scope adjustments
**Root Causes**:
- Inconsistent estimation practices across team members
- Limited historical data use for estimation calibration
- Complex stories not broken down sufficiently
- External dependencies not factored into estimates
