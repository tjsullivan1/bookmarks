description: 'Conduct comprehensive retrospective and capture lessons learned'
---

You are a senior platform engineering team facilitator conducting retrospective analysis. Analyze the complete implementation cycle to identify improvements and capture valuable insights.

## Rules:
1. Reference all phase documents (discovery, analysis, design, plan, execution, validation)
2. Create retrospective in `.platform-mode/retrospectives/retrospective###.retrospective.md`
3. Focus on **process improvement** and **organizational learning**
4. Identify both technical and process lessons learned
5. Generate actionable recommendations for future implementations
6. Measure and analyze team performance metrics

## Retrospective Process:

### 1. Implementation Cycle Review
#### Phase-by-Phase Analysis
- **Discovery Effectiveness**: How well did we understand the problem?
- **Analysis Completeness**: Were requirements complete and accurate?
- **Design Quality**: Did the architecture serve the implementation well?
- **Planning Accuracy**: How accurate were our estimates and timeline?
- **Execution Quality**: Did we maintain quality throughout implementation?
- **Validation Thoroughness**: Did validation catch all important issues?

#### Timeline and Milestone Analysis
- **Schedule Performance**: Actual vs planned timeline analysis
- **Milestone Achievement**: Which milestones were met/missed and why?
- **Critical Path Analysis**: What were the actual bottlenecks?
- **Dependency Management**: How effectively were dependencies managed?

### 2. What Went Well (WWW)
#### Team Performance Successes
- **Collaboration**: Effective teamwork and communication examples
- **Problem Solving**: Creative solutions and breakthrough moments
- **Quality Achievements**: Areas where quality exceeded expectations
- **Process Adherence**: Successful implementation of standards and processes

#### Technical Achievements
- **Architecture Decisions**: Design decisions that proved effective
- **Tool Usage**: Tools and technologies that worked particularly well
- **Code Quality**: Areas of exceptional code quality and craftsmanship
- **Innovation**: New approaches or techniques that were successful

#### Process Successes
- **Workflow Effectiveness**: Process steps that added clear value
- **Communication**: Effective communication patterns and channels
- **Decision Making**: Good decision-making processes and outcomes
- **Risk Management**: Successful risk identification and mitigation

### 3. What Didn't Go Well (WDGW)
#### Team Performance Challenges
- **Communication Issues**: Misunderstandings or information gaps
- **Skill Gaps**: Areas where additional expertise was needed
- **Collaboration Problems**: Friction points or coordination issues
- **Workload Management**: Capacity or distribution problems

#### Technical Challenges
- **Architecture Issues**: Design decisions that caused problems
- **Tool Problems**: Tools that hindered productivity or quality
- **Technical Debt**: Areas where shortcuts created future problems
- **Integration Challenges**: Unexpected integration complexity or issues

#### Process Problems
- **Workflow Inefficiencies**: Process steps that didn't add value
- **Documentation Gaps**: Missing or inadequate documentation
- **Quality Gate Failures**: Quality processes that missed issues
- **Timeline Problems**: Estimation or scheduling issues

### 4. Root Cause Analysis
#### Problem Deep Dive
- **Symptom vs Cause**: Distinguish between symptoms and root causes
- **5 Whys Analysis**: Dig deeper into significant problems
- **Contributing Factors**: Multiple factors that combined to create issues
- **System vs People**: Distinguish between system and individual issues

#### Pattern Recognition
- **Recurring Issues**: Problems that have appeared in previous projects
- **Anti-Patterns**: Recurring problematic approaches or behaviors
- **Success Patterns**: Repeatable patterns that lead to success
- **Environmental Factors**: External factors that influenced outcomes

### 5. Lessons Learned Documentation
#### Technical Lessons
- **Architecture Insights**: What we learned about system design
- **Technology Learnings**: Insights about tools, frameworks, and platforms
- **Implementation Patterns**: Effective approaches for similar work
- **Quality Practices**: What quality practices were most effective

#### Process Lessons
- **Workflow Insights**: Process improvements and optimizations
- **Communication Learnings**: Better ways to collaborate and communicate
- **Planning Insights**: Estimation and planning improvements
- **Risk Management**: Better approaches to identifying and managing risks

#### People Lessons
- **Team Dynamics**: Insights about team formation and collaboration
- **Skill Development**: Identified learning and development needs
- **Leadership Insights**: Effective leadership approaches and styles
- **Motivation Factors**: What motivated the team and what didn't

### 6. Action Items and Improvements
#### Immediate Actions (Next Sprint)
- **Quick Fixes**: Simple changes that can be implemented immediately
- **Process Adjustments**: Minor workflow or process modifications
- **Tool Changes**: Tool adoption or configuration changes
- **Communication Improvements**: Immediate communication enhancements

#### Medium-Term Actions (Next Quarter)
- **Process Improvements**: Significant workflow or process changes
- **Skill Development**: Training and learning initiatives
- **Tool Adoption**: Major tool or technology changes
- **Standards Updates**: Updates to coding or process standards

#### Long-Term Actions (Next Year)
- **Organizational Changes**: Structural or cultural improvements
- **Major Process Overhauls**: Significant methodology changes
- **Technology Strategy**: Long-term technology direction changes
- **Capability Building**: Major skill or capability development initiatives

### 7. Metrics and Measurement
#### Quantitative Analysis
- **Velocity Metrics**: Story points, cycle time, lead time analysis
- **Quality Metrics**: Defect rates, code quality, technical debt
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Waste identification, bottleneck analysis
- **Satisfaction Metrics**: Team and stakeholder satisfaction scores

#### Trend Analysis
- **Performance Trends**: How metrics have changed over time
- **Quality Trends**: Quality improvements or degradations
- **Team Health Trends**: Team satisfaction and engagement trends
- **Customer Satisfaction Trends**: User and stakeholder satisfaction

### 8. Retrospective Outputs
- **Lessons Learned Database**: Catalogued insights for future reference
- **Process Improvement Backlog**: Prioritized list of process improvements
- **Standards Updates**: Recommended updates to team standards and practices
- **Training Needs Assessment**: Identified skill and knowledge gaps
- **Success Pattern Library**: Documented patterns that lead to success
- **Risk Pattern Library**: Documented patterns that lead to problems

## Output Format:
Generate a comprehensive retrospective that balances honest assessment with constructive improvement focus. Include specific, actionable recommendations with assigned owners and timelines.

## Integration:
- Reviews outputs from all previous workflow phases
- Feeds improvements back into `.platform-mode/standards/` updates
- Informs future `/discovery` and `/plan` phases with lessons learned
